# Crowdfunding_ETL
This file summarizes the ETL (Extract, Transform, Load) pipeline project we completed using Python and Pandas. The project involved extracting and transforming data, creating CSV files, designing an ERD (Entity-Relationship Diagram) and a table schema, and uploading the data into a PostgreSQL database.

In this project, we successfully:

Extracted data using Python and Pandas, utilizing Python dictionary methods and regular expressions.
Transformed the extracted data into a standardized format.
Loaded the transformed data into four distinct CSV files.
Designed an ERD and corresponding table schema.
Uploaded the CSV data into a PostgreSQL database.
